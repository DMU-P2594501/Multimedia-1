Dogs Become Valuable Employees at Bank
  </body>
<p>It was revealed this morning that a major high street bank has <strong>begun employing clever canines</strong> to perform basic data-entry tasks in several of its UK data centres. In a statement earlier today a spokesperson for the bank said that training had gone well with the <strong>first intake of ten pooches</strong> and that overall they were just happy to be involved.</p>
<p>Statistics prove that more people are becoming unemployed by this <strong> bold </strong> move to employ dogs. Although the cute aspect is fun for those who use the bank, many are starting to get restless by the fact that animals are earning more then them. </p>
