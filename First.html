Dogs Become Valuable Employees at Bank
  </background-color cyan>
  </body>
<p>It was revealed this morning that a major high street bank has <strong>begun employing clever canines</strong> to perform basic data-entry tasks in several of its UK data centres. In a statement earlier today a spokesperson for the bank said that training had gone well with the <strong>first intake of ten pooches</strong> and that overall they were just happy to be involved.</p>
<p>Statistics prove that more people are becoming unemployed by this <strong> bold </strong> move to employ dogs. Although the cute aspect is fun for those who use the bank, many are starting to get restless by the fact that animals are earning more then them. </p>

  <p>"I've made new friends, we have a great canteen, and in a few months I'll have earned enough for a deposit on my own kennel"</p>

  <h2>5 reasons why the dogs love working at the bank</h2>
  <ol>
  <li>They have all stated that they love the attention given to them by customers, they love being petted</li>
  <li>They also feel like they need to help out more financially around the house instead of sleeping all day</li>
  <li>They love wearing ties as it makes them look adorable (also brings in more customers as they are curious)</li>
  <li>They all believe it is more efficient to work as well as their owners so they don't have to wait around all day until they get home</li>
  <li>Lastly, free food is always a motivator when it comes to dogs</li>
  </ol>
    
  <h3>Businesses Suited to Animal Employees</h3>
  
  <p>Many businesses could benefit from embracing our feathered and furry friends in the workplace.</p>
  
  <h4>Cafes</h4>
  
  <p>Perhaps you've been to a cat cafe already? Relax with a coffee and be soothed by the elegant slow dance and soft purring of some feline friends.</p>
  
  <h5>Hospitals</h5>
  
  <p>Hospitals often have a need to move small things like sample tubes and paperwork to other parts of the hospital quickly, often along long narrow corridors. Parrots would be perfectly suited to this role, and would also help brighten things up, adding a little cheer for those enjoying a temporary stay.</p>

  <h6>Window Cleaning</h6>
  
  <p>If window cleaners used Pelicans to hold their water, instead of carrying a bucket up a ladder, it's estimated that 356 window cleaning injuries a year could be avoided. They're also good company on a lunch break.</p>
